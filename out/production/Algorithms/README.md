# Algorithms
We have all the sorting algorithms mentioned in the paper.
You can look through them to see our implementations of said algorithms.
We used an interface that helped with testing our implementations.
We then have a main where we call all the algorithms together.
Give the test sizes that we want to test, in the array testSize[]. 
Give the number of trials to the final int TRIALS.
Adjust the range of numbers used in the arrays in generateRandomArray
Then give a name for the file to the printed.
